# Onewheel-PEV-Open-source-BMS-
Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share with you my ongoing project focused on developing a Battery Management System (BMS) specifically tailored for Onewheel electric skateboards. While it's still a work in progress, I wanted to give the community a glimpse of what I've been working on and invite any enthusiasts who are interested in contributing to the project.

I've provided all the Bill of Materials (BOM) files for the BMS, and although there are still some kinks to iron out, I believe it's a solid foundation for further development. If you're interested in collaborating or contributing, feel free to reach out to me on Discord. Additionally, for those who'd like to try out a sample, you can easily order one through JLC PCB.

One of the current challenges with this version is its complexity. While it's compatible with battery configurations ranging from 15s to 20s, I acknowledge that simplicity is key. Therefore, I'm planning to streamline the design for the upcoming version 2. In version 2, I'll focus on catering to the most commonly used configurations within the Onewheel community, namely 15s, 18s, and 20s setups.

Thank You for visting my project contact me at Bazing89 on discord.
